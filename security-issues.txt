# Security Issues Log

## Session 2 (Dec 25, 2024)

### Resolved Issues
- **Input Validation**: Implemented strict Zod schemas for all model selection inputs (URL params, localStorage).
- **Memory Leaks**: Added `isMounted` ref check in `useModelSelection` to prevent state updates on unmounted components.
- **Data Exposure**: Verified no PII or sensitive system info is logged to console. Errors are generic.
- **Storage Safety**: Added try-catch blocks around localStorage operations to handle quota errors gracefully.

### Verification
- Static Analysis: Manual code review passed.
- Runtime Analysis: Verified via unit tests with mock inputs.
